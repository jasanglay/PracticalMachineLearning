### Course Project: Prediction Model of the Manner of Execution of Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl

In this project, a prediction model is developed to determine the quality of performance of unilateral dumbbell biceps curl, which is a weighlifting exercise, from data of accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of six (6) male participants. The participants have performed the barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The whole data can be retrieved from the website below.

The variable *classe* from the data set is predicted using a model developed from a training set and validated using another set. The developed model is then used to predict 20 different test cases.
